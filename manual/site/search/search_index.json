Getting started Download SFZBuilder (can be the compiled binaries or directly from Python source code) Get the init folder Now you can install SFZPacks. A SFZPack is a collection of mappings and presets that SFZBuilder can load and use them. A good start are: SFZBuilder Factory Library DEMO gm.dls (need sample extraction) Fairlight IIx After you have some stuff to work with, run SFZBuilder. Now in Main Folder button, select the init folder you downloaded before and installed SFZPacks and restart the software. Now you're ready. Simple introduction to SFZ SFZ is designed to be human readable enough and easy to edit for end users (no need for anything special other than a text editor). Although the standard is giving a whole Graphical User Interface to end users to design and tweak the settings for their samples. SFZBuilder let you have the best of both worlds: the flexibility and freedom of a text based format and the convenience of a Graphical User Interface to design sounds. You have the SFZ file, where the information is stored, and then the SFZ Player, which is the engine that let you hear what you have in a SFZ file. SFZBuilder covers the two main players: sfizz and Sforzando , all of them free of charge. The syntax is very simple, there are two types: the header and the opcode The header is the way to assing opcodes, the most basic one being <region> . The name explains itself, is where you set the regions for your samples. Under any region, you have to write opcodes, the structure of a opcode is type_of_data=value Example: <region> sample=my/path/to/sample.wav lokey=60 hikey=72 lovel=50 hivel=80 // and so on... If you do not write one of the hundred of opcodes, the SFZ player will set the default values of each one automatically for you. There are other headers than <region> , such as <group> which essentially is \"every opcode I write under this header, will be heredated to the regions\" This is the most basic introduction, for detailed information and the full list of documented opcodes, check the sfz format website SFZ structure used SFZBuilder has this hierarchy using the available headers of the SFZ format, being: header usage <global> for values that needs to be applied to all mappings <master> every configuration for each individual mapping <group> header to enable FX tricks using a pitch LFO (it duplicates the same mapping but with different configurations) <region> the sample and mapping information, being a SFZ file called from MappingPool folder SFZBuilder interface 1. SFZ info Autoname : once pressed, it will extract the name of the current mapping the user has selected in the List of mappings , as a shortcut for file names. SFZ Name : here you write the name you want for your SFZ preset. Author : here you write your name or nickname, you can set a default one where SFZBuilder will load it everytime it runs through the Set Default button. 2. Global This section is for everything that is set under the <global> header. Keyswitch : You set the global range of such keyswitchs and the default key for it. Oversampling : This one is exclusive from Sforzando. It's using the opcode hint_min_samplerate . The purpose is to reduce aliasing for high frequencies. Portamento : This one uses a template available in Opcodes tab. You set the time of such portamento or assign a Continuous Controller to set it. 3. Mappings Type of map selector : Here you select which kind of map you want to load. Map : melodic mappings, it is a collection of regions. Percussion : percussive mappings, this one is intended to be customizable the root note of the samples to create your own percussion mappings. Wavetable : mappings where it uses a wavetable WAV file or a collection of wavetables inside a SFZ file as regions using the opcode oscillator_on . This feature is implemented correctly only in sfizz. The maps to select are based on PACK and then MAP . You can scroll with the mouse wheel or click it to browse all the mappings. 4. Mapping features Volume : Set the volume of the mapping. Mute Map : Mutes the map. Useful when debugging a preset. Key : This one sets a key range of the mapping. It uses the locc hicc opcode with the extended CC 133 Vel : This one sets a velocity range of the mapping. It uses the locc hicc opcode with the extended CC 131 . NOTE: This opcode with extended CC (131) doesn't mute the last sample when switching between velocities, this is not helpful for certain contexts or could have polyphony issues. note on : This one let you set a range of CC where the regions of the mapping can be played if is under that value range. Normally used to switch between pedal and sustain mappings in pianos. Program Change : It let you set a program change to the mapping if enabled. This is useful to create a Soundfont style bank in a SFZ file. There's a box where you have a list of .ins files to select with Cakewalk's Instrument Definition specification that gives a name for each program change value. The factory ones are General MIDI and Roland MT-32 . NOTE FOR SFIZZ USERS: The program change feature is implemented only in the LV2 version. 5. Mapping List The mapping list has 6 buttons: + Mapping: It adds a mapping with the default indexes of PACK+MAP. - Delete : It deletes the selected mapping. Clone: It clones the selected mapping with all the configuration. Import: You select a .sfzproj file and then choose the mappings you want to import with the whole configuration. You have to make sure the imported mapping includes the PACK+MAP needed for it, otherwise it will load the default one. Up/Down: Move the mapping to certain hierarchy. NOTE: If you're stacking Wavetables and samples (Map/Percussion) you must put every wavetable map as first in the list to make it work. 6. Mapping Values In this section, you specify every aspect that SFZ can give in the selected mapping. 6.1. Map Comment: Here is where you write a commment about the mapping. Useful to have reference what is this mapping about, for example: sustain notes , release map , dry chorus map , ... Output: It sets the bus output of the mapping. Sfizz supports 8 output audio channels that can be mapped in your DAW. This is useful for anything related to drums (separate the outputs of drums, cymbals, mic positions, ...) Stereo Width: Let you manipulate the stereo effect of the samples in the mapping, being the value 0 mono. Of course, only works with stereo samples. Use Tuned Variant Instead: This checkbox is special and only is enabled if the selected mapping includes a tuned version of it. The reason for this feature is because there are people who prefer the natural tunning of the instruments and others prefer to have them perfectly tuned with the tune opcode. In the SFZ files, the tuned mappings has the exact name but with a --TN suffix. Polyphony Polyphony: It sets the polyphony limit of the mapping. This is helpful to optimize the polyphony in drums. Be careful when using the FX LFO feature, depending on the mode, you will need to have 2, 3 or even 4 polyphony per note in the mappping. Note Polyphony: Polyphony limit for playing the same note repeatedly. Note Selfmask: Controls note-stealing behavior for a single pitch, when using Note Polyphony. Trigger Mode: Sets the trigger mode of the mapping. For example, for a release mapping, you should select release . The other modes are used in advanced mappings with true legato samples. rt_dead: Controls whether a release sample should play if its sustain sample has ended, or not. rt_decay: Applies only to regions that triggered through trigger=release. The volume decrease (in decibels) per seconds after the corresponding attack region was triggered. Keyswitch: This works if you enable keyswitch from Global. Key: Sets the specific key where the mapping will be enabled. Label: Sets the label of such keyswitch, useful for the end user to know which key enables which. Key/Percussion Set 'pitch_keycenter': This works if you use a Percussion mapping. It let you set the root note of the drum/percussive instrument. Use 'key' opcode instead: This works if you enabled pitch_keycenter, basically replaces such opcode with key which set the mapping to be played only in the defined root note. Wavetable: This section is enabled if you use a Wavetable mapping/wav file.","title":"Welcome to SFZBuilder Manual"},{"location":"#welcome-to-sfzbuilder-manual","text":"Here you will find all the features SFZBuilder can offer.","title":"Welcome to SFZBuilder Manual"},{"location":"#getting-started","text":"Download SFZBuilder (can be the compiled binaries or directly from Python source code) Get the init folder Now you can install SFZPacks.
